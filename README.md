Needs Matlab 2023a or newer.

"Compression" contains a speed improved SAR compression algorithm that uses the CC[1] and CO[2] criteria in the iterative algorithm proposed by Orzada et al.[3]

"PostProc" contains a speed improved Virtual Observation Point (VOP) postprocessing algorithm that uses both the CC[1] and CO[2] critria within the post processing algorithm proposed by Orzada et al.[4]
